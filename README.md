# Junit-test-learning
Using a Cruise Control template to learn how to use teststub and Junit
1.	Complete project code (“Cruise Control”), with the source code the professor gives and test scripts code. (Attention, if want to 
               run the Junit test, please change the file path read in the four jtest file. For example, 
              “FileReader fr=new FileReader("D:/Cruise Control/AllEdgeFaster.txt");”, you should change 
              the "D:/Cruise Control/AllEdgeFaster.txt" to where you put the “ALLEdgeFaster.txt”). It a project created by Eclipse Java 2018-09, 
               I am not sure what will happen in other versions when you want to run the project.

2.	Four test suites and corresponding expected output (in All test suites and expected output folder)
                   (AllEdgeFaster.txt/ AllEdgeFasterOracle.txt;
                   EdgePairFaster.txt/ EdgePairFasterOracle.txt;
                   EdgePairSlower.txt/ EdgePairSlowerOracle.txt;
                   AllEdgeSlower.txt/ AllEdgeSlowerOracle.txt)
